# Ultimate Go with Bill Kennedy

## my stream of conscious-esque notes of bill advice

- mechanical sympathy— learn about the hardware and operating system to be sympathetic
- “engineering not about watching a piece of software and watching it work in production”
- anyone can google source code and get code that works
- it’s more about— writing software that runs when shit hits the fan
- understand every decision you’re making, the benefit you’re getting from that decision, and the cost (because nothing is free)
- champion quality, efficiency, simplicity
- have a point of view — value introspection and self-review
- easy to adopt new technology but hard to adopt new ways of thinking
- if you’re stuck for twenty minutes, then ask for help
- is performance the most important priority? (no!!!!!!!)
- C is more bugs.. // trade off between performance and productivity
- “the most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry.” - henry petroski 2015
- replace C with go and it matches.
- can almost do anything u want by coding very straightforwardly.
- go doesn’t have virtual machine like C#, ruby, etc.
- so you have to visualize how your code will run on the machine.
- optimizing for correctness
- “idiomatic” is whatever— better to have your code in production lol
- Go is 6 years old— tiny; so also a tiny amount of bad code
- guess who’s the expert, since people barely know it lol
- look at it as— you’re doing to have to explain/teach this material in the future
